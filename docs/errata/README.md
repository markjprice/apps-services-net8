# Common Mistakes, Improvements, and Errata aka list of corrections

If you find any mistakes in the first edition, *Apps and Services with .NET 8*, or if you have suggestions for improvements, then please [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/issues) or email me at markjprice (at) gmail.com.

[**Errata** (2 items)](errata.md): Typos, tool user interface and behavior changes, or mistakes in code that would cause a compilation error that prevents a successful build.

[**Improvements** (3 items)](improvements.md): Changes to text or code that would improve the content. These are optional.

[**Common Mistakes** (6 items)](https://github.com/markjprice/cs12dotnet8/blob/main/docs/errata/common-mistakes.md): These are some of the most common errors that a reader might encounter when trying to get code in book tasks to work, or when trying to write your own code. (Links to the C# 12 and .NET 8 book repository.)

All errata and improvements will be included in the 3rd edition planned for publishing in November 2024. To be included they must be submitted by mid-September 2024.
