# Improvements and Errata aka list of corrections

If you find any mistakes in the first edition, *Apps and Services with .NET 8*, or if you have suggestions for improvements, then please [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/markjprice/apps-services-net8/issues) or email me at markjprice (at) gmail.com.

[**Errata** (18 items)](errata.md): Typos, tool user interface and behavior changes, or mistakes in code that would cause a compilation error that prevents a successful build.

[**Improvements** (19 items)](improvements.md): Changes to text or code that would improve the content. These are optional.

[**Common Mistakes**](https://github.com/markjprice/markjprice/blob/main/articles/common-mistakes.md): These are some of the most common errors that a reader might encounter when trying to get code in book tasks to work, or when trying to write your own code. (Links to the `markjprice` repository for shared articles.)

All errata and improvements will be included in the 3rd edition planned for publishing in January 2026. To be included they must be submitted by October 2024.
