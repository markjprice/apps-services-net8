## Code solutions for Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code now has an extension named **C# Dev Kit** that includes a solution explorer so it can better work with Visual Studio 2022 solution files. Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code + C# Dev Kit, and JetBrains Rider can now use the same code solution files and projects for each chapter, found here: [/code](/code). 

> **For Visual Studio Code:** To use the chapter solution files with Visual Studio Code, install the **C# Dev Kit** extension. Then in Visual Studio Code, open the `ChapterNN` folder that contains a `ChapterNN.sln` solution file and wait for the **SOLUTION EXPLORER** pane to appear at the bottom of the **EXPLORER**. You can drag and drop to reorder the panes to put **SOLUTION EXPLORER** at the top. Learn more about C# Dev Kit at the following link: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/announcing-csharp-dev-kit-for-visual-studio-code/

> **Warning!** If you use multiple code editors to open these solutions, then be aware that the build process can conflict. This is because Visual Studio 2022 has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK CLI. My recommendation is to only have a solution open in one code editor at any time. You should also clean the solutions between closing and opening in different code editors. For example, after closing the solution in one code editor, I delete the `bin` and `obj` folders before then opening in a different code editor.

Microsoft used to have professional exams and certifications for developers that covered skills like C# and ASP.NET. Sadly, they have retired them all. These days, the only developer-adjacent exams and certifications are for Azure or Power Platform, as you can see from the certification poster: https://aka.ms/traincertposter
